## GeoTag for macOS -- macOS 10.13 or later

GeoTag is a free OS X single window application that allows you to update image
metadata with geolocation tags by selecting one or more images then panning and
zooming within a a map to the place the image was recorded. Clicking on the map
will add the location to the selected photos.  Clicking on a new location will
change the geolocation for the selected photos.  Zoom in on the map and fine
tune the location with a click.  The built in ExifTool utility is used to write
location data to the images when you save your changes.  ExifTool only modifies
image metadata -- your image pixels are not touched.

See <http://exiftool.org> for information about ExifTool.
**ExifTool is built in to GeoTag.**

## GeoTag 4.10

### New Feature

* Add preference item to preserve the original image file
  modification time when updating GeoLocation data.

* Add "Discard tracks" under the File menu. All tracks are cleared from the map.

* Allow paste into change timestamp and update location windows.

* Paste into images when not using the Update Location window now has a new
  format.  The format is "lat | lon" where lat and lon may be one of the
  following formats.

  -dd.dddd R            Coordinate in degrees
  -dd mm.mmmm R         Coordinate in degrees and minutes
  -dd mm ss.ssss R      Coordinate in degrees, minutes, and seconds

  S latitudes and W longitudes can be indicated by a negative number
  of degrees or the appropriate reference (R) value.  It is an error if both
  are used.  Degree (°), Minute ('), and Second (") marks are optional
  and ignored if found at the end of a value.

* Update to exiftool 12.12

* Compiled to also run on Apple Silicon

### Known Bugs

* Race condition: When photos with the same name are among multiple images
  opened one may fail to open.  An alert will is displayed when this
  happens.

* Setting the date of an image outside of the range of 1970-2034 may result in
  an incorrect GPS Date Stamp.  This is a limitation of how GeoTag, ExifTool,
  and macOS libraries handle date and time.  One hopes that the year 2034 limit
  will eventually be removed ;)

### See the file named *History* for other changes and bug fixes

### Image Backups

* A "backup folder" location is required.  If a backup folder is not configured
  when GeoTag starts the program will open the preferences window for you to
  select a location.
* When saving geo location data to an image a copy of the un-edited image is
  placed in the backup folder. If an image of the same name exists in that folder
  a numbered suffix will be added to the name.   The name with the highest
  numbered suffix is the most current backup (usually).
* If the image file can not be copied to the backup location Geolocation
  information will not be saved.   Better to be safe than sorry.

### General Note

Photos (OSX 10.10.3 and later) will let you modify existing location metadata
but not add location data to an image. If necessary use GeoTag to add location
metadata **before** importing the images into Photos. This may aslo hold true
for other image editing applications.

### Operating Instructions:

*See <https://www.snafu.org/GeoTag/NewGeoTagHelp/> for more information.*

Run Program.  Use the Open command from the menu or ⌘O to select files to
modify. You can also drag files from the finder into the table on the left side
of the application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files.  Such files can not be modified.   Dragging
or opening a folder will add all the files in the folder and any subfolders.

Select one or more images. When selecting multiple images the last image
selected is displayed in the image well (upper right portion of the window).
Its location (if any) is marked on the map.  When multiple rows are selected
the latitude and longitude of the image displayed in the image well and marked
on the map location will be shown in yellow.

Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can be changed by clicking on the desired location. Hitting the delete key
will remove location information from all selected images.  You can Undo/Redo
image location changes.

Double click to zoom in.  Or use the pinch gestures to zoom in and out.

GeoTag can interpolate positions for images between two images with assigned
locations.   This might be useful where you know starting and ending locations
and would like to approximate where on the straight path between the two
other images may have been taken.  To use this feature:

* Load a series of images to be tagged into GeoTag
* Assign a location to the first image in your series of images.
* Assign a location to the last image in your series of images.
* Select all images in the series from first to last.
* Use the menu item "Edit -> Interpolate" to assign location to the
  intermediate images in your series of images.

Three map types --- Standard, Hybrid, and Satellite --- are supported. You
can also use street view, but... the latitude and longitude of a map marker
in street view do not match the same marker on one of the other three map
views.

If you find yourself working in a specific area of a map you can save
the map type, location, and zoom level by clicking on the *Save Map Location*
button.   When GeoTag is launched the map will load to the last saved
location.

You may cut or copy location information from a single image and then paste
that information into one or more images.  If you make an error you can
undo/redo your changes. You can undo all changes to all images by selecting
"Discard changes" from the "File" menu.  All Undo/Redo information is cleared
once changes are discarded or saved.

The original versions of images that have been updated are saved are in a
backup folder.  The backup folder may be changed using GeoTag Preferences.
The first time GeoTag is run it will prompt you to select a backup folder.
Images updates can not be saved until a backup folder is selected.

Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Interpolate, and Clear Image List can be accessed from
a pop up menu by right clicking on an entry in the list.
