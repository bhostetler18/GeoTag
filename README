## GeoTag for macOS -- macOS 13 or later

GeoTag is a free OS X single window application that allows you to update image
metadata with geolocation tags by selecting one or more images then panning and
zooming within a a map to the place the image was recorded. Clicking on the map
will add the location to the selected photos.  Clicking on a new location will
change the geolocation for the selected photos.  Zoom in on the map and fine
tune the location with a click.  The built in ExifTool utility is used to write
location data to the images when you save your changes.  ExifTool only modifies
image metadata -- your image pixels are not touched.

See <http://exiftool.org> for information about ExifTool.
**ExifTool is built in to GeoTag.**

GeoTag Version 5 is a re-write of the program taking advantage of features in
the current version of macOS. Those not using macOS Ventura can still use GeoTag
versio 4.15.

GeoTag is available from several sources
* [App Store Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/geotag/id1465180184?mt=12)
* [GeoTag home page](https://www.snafu.org/GeoTag/)
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) cask.  Homebrew users can use the command
  `brew cask install geotag` to install.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/marchyman/GeoTag)

## WIP (will be GeoTag 5)

### Updates

* better performance using structured concurency where possible

* Set elevation/altitude when assigning locations from track logs.

* User option to enable/disable the jpeg part of a raw/jpeg pair

* User option to add a finder tag to updated images.

* The function to interpolate image location was removed.

* (internal) Exiftool version 12.49

* (internal) User Interface code re-written to use SwiftUI

### Known Bugs

* Setting the date of an image outside of the range of 1970-2034 may result in
  an incorrect GPS Date Stamp.  This is a limitation of how GeoTag, ExifTool,
  and macOS libraries handle date and time.  One hopes that the year 2034 limit
  will eventually be removed ;)

### General Note

Photos (OSX 10.10.3 and later) will let you modify existing location metadata
but not add location data to an image. If necessary use GeoTag to add location
metadata **before** importing the images into Photos. This may aslo hold true
for other image editing applications.

### Operating Instructions:

*See <https://www.snafu.org/GeoTag/GeoTag5Help/> for more information.*

Run Program.  Use the Open command from the menu or ⌘O to select files to
modify. You can also drag files from the finder into the table on the left side
of the application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files or are disabled for other reasons.  Such files
can not be modified. Dragging or opening a folder will add all the files
in the folder and any subfolders.

Select one or more images. When selecting multiple images one of the
images is considered the "most selected". The name of the most selected
image is shown in yellow using a bolder font.  The thumbnail of the most
selected image is displayed in the image well (upper right portion of the
window). Its location (if any) is marked on the map.

Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can be changed by clicking on the desired location. Hitting the delete
key will remove location information from all selected images.  You can
Undo/Redo image location changes.

Double click the map to zoom in.  Or use the pinch gestures to zoom in and out.

Three map types --- Standard, Hybrid, and Satellite --- are supported. You
can also use street view, but... the latitude and longitude of a map marker
in street view do not match the same marker on one of the other three map
views.

If you find yourself working in a specific area of a map you can save
the map type, location, and zoom level by clicking on the *Save map location*
button.   When GeoTag is launched the map will load to the last saved
location.

You may cut or copy location information from a single image and then paste
that information into one or more images.  If you make an error you can
undo/redo your changes. You can undo all changes to all images by selecting
"Discard changes" from the "File" menu.  All Undo/Redo information is cleared
once changes are discarded or saved.

The original versions of images that have been updated are saved are in a
backup folder.  The backup folder may be changed using GeoTag Preferences.
The first time GeoTag is run it will prompt you to select a backup folder.
Images updates can not be saved until a backup folder is selected or backups
are disabled (not recommended).

Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, and Clear Image List can be accessed from
a pop up menu by right clicking on an entry in the list.

### Build Instructions for developers
