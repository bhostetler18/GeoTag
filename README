## GeoTag for macOS -- macOS 14 or later

GeoTag is a free OS X single window application that allows you to update image
metadata with geolocation tags by selecting one or more images then panning and
zooming within a a map to the place the image was recorded. Clicking on the map
will add the location to the selected photos.  Clicking on a new location will
change the geolocation for the selected photos.  Zoom in on the map and fine
tune the location with a click.  The built in ExifTool utility is used to write
location data to the images when you save your changes.  ExifTool only modifies
image metadata -- your image pixels are not touched.

See <http://exiftool.org> for information about ExifTool.
**ExifTool is built in to GeoTag.**

GeoTag 5.2+ requires macOS Sonoma or later.  Use GeoTag 5.1 if running on
macOS Ventura.  Those running earlier versions of macOS can use GeoTag
version 4.15.

## branch newmaps

- strip out the NSViewRepresentable MapView and replace it with a
  SwiftUI implementation. I think I'll be able to do everything but
  drag pins.

### Updates

- Images can be selected from your Photos Library.  Timestamps and locations
  can be changed and "written" back to the library. The original file is not
  modified. No backups are made.
- Map pins can not be dragged. Click on the desired location to move a pin.
- Copied/Cut coordinates are now in the same format as selected in GeoTag
  settings.
- Map configuration options are now in a map context (right click) menu.
- At an appropriate zoom level you are given the option to use a 3D map
  representation.  Look for the "3D" button near the upper right corner of
  the map.
- The last 10 map searches are saved across GeoTag runs.
- Updated app icon to match current guidelines re size and rounded corners
- Bug Fix: cancelling a search no longer looks up whatever happended to
  be typed into the search bar.
- Bug Fix: Changing the map style no longer repositions the map.
- Bug Fix: Coordinate format changes take effect immediately in the image table.
- Bug Fix: Data in XMP sidecar files was not read unless the XMP file was in
  a folder that was opened or the XMP file itself was explicity opened.
  Note: xmp files can no longer be selected to open.
- Bug Fix: Duplicate image processing does more than give a warning.
- Bug Fix: extraneous map centering removed

### Issues

- undo/redo menu items are always enabled, even when there are no undo or
  redo actions that could be performed. The menu titles are also not updated
  for the action to be performed.
- There is a short delay between clicking on the map and a map pin being
  placed.
- When showing pins for all selected locations the red (most selected) pin
  may be hidden by the pin of another location near by unless the zoom level
  is such that both locations are slightly separated on the map.
- when changing the selection to an image that has a location some of the pin
  may off the map view.  In an extreme case only the point of the pin is on
  the map and can not be seen. If you do not see a pin when you expect to
  zoom out slightly.

### General Note

Photos (OSX 10.10.3 and later) will let you modify existing location metadata
but not add location data to an image. Use GeoTag to add location metadata
**before** importing the images into Photos. This may also hold true for other
image editing applications.

### Operating Instructions:

*See <https://www.snafu.org/GeoTag/GeoTag5Help/> for more information.*

Run Program.  Use the Open command from the menu or ⌘O to select files to
modify. You can also drag files from the finder into the table on the left side
of the application window.  File names shown in a light grey color are not
recognized as valid image files or are disabled for other reasons.  Such files
can not be modified. Dragging or opening a folder will add all the files
in the folder and any subfolders.

Select one or more images. When selecting multiple images one of the
images is considered the "most selected". The name of the most selected
image is shown in yellow using a bolder font.  The thumbnail of the most
selected image is displayed in the image well (upper right portion of the
window). Its location (if any) is marked on the map.

Click on the map to set or change the location of all selected images. Existing
location can be changed by clicking on the desired location. Hitting the delete
key will remove location information from all selected images.  You can
Undo/Redo image location changes.

Double click the map to zoom in. Option-double click to zoom out. Or use
pinch gestures to zoom in and out if using a touch pad.

Five map styles --- Standard, Imagery, Hybrid, Standard with traffic, and
Hybrid with traffic --- are supported. Right click on the map to select
the desired map style. If you find yourself working in a specific area of a
map you can save the location and zoom level by right clicking on the map
and selecting *Save map location*.  When GeoTag is launched the map will
load to the last saved location using the last map style selected.

You may cut or copy location information from a single image and then paste
that information into one or more images.  If you make an error you can
undo/redo your changes. You can undo all changes to all images by selecting
"Discard changes" from the "File" menu.  All Undo/Redo information is cleared
once changes are discarded or saved.

The original versions of images that have been updated are saved are in a
backup folder.  The backup folder may be changed using GeoTag Settings.
The first time GeoTag is run it will prompt you to select a backup folder.
Images updates can not be saved until a backup folder is selected or backups
are disabled (not recommended).

Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, and Clear Image List can be accessed from
a pop up menu by right clicking on an entry in the list.
