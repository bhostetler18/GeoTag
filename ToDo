save changes (file menu)
- copy image array ✓
- create task group ✓
- save each image in a task
- if the save is good update the original values in viewmodel copy of image,
  not the copy. ✓
- if all images were saved clear the isEdited flag
  -- unless other edits happened when the save was in progress?
  -- Clear the undo stack -- unless other edits occurred?
     I could perhaps create a new UndoManager and use it to determine
     if edits had been made?
- if there were errors during save indicate the errors, perhaps on a sheet
  showing which files had issues and maybe what the issue was.
