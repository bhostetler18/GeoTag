Bugs:

* If you select an image that has a location and them pan the map to some
  other locations, changing the map style causes the map to re-center around
  the pin if the pin is off screen. If the pin is on screen the map viewport
  doesn’t change.

* Sometimes ⌘Z appears to do nothing, requiring a second invocation to
  perform the undo action.

Misc:
* Clean up lat/lon display, perhaps use NumberFormater?

Feature Requests:
* check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the user
  if necessary.
* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.
