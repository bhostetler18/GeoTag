Known bugs are now in the README file

Feature Requests:
- Access images in the photos library.
- check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the
  user if necessary.
- Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

WIP notes

- needs lots of testing
- map being centered when image selected even when the image would otherwise
  have been seen.
