Create sidecar option???
Right pane divider location on start -- partially fixed
When Metal validation enabled program crashes when divider is moved
Bugs:
* Open With doesn't work
* add option to hide grayed out images?

Fixed:

* map search bar alignment (trailing)
* Add command-L as shortcut for locn from track
* do not apply track log points when time +/- 6 hours of image time
* Loading good and bad track log resulted multiple sheets

Feature Requests:

* Add and option to show the location of all selected images.

* check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the user
  if necessary.

* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.
