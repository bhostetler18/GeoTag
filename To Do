Bugs:

* Keyboard shortcuts for cut/copy/delete/paste/select all do not work
  when editing text fields, i.e. latitude, longitude, and timestamps.
  Main menu items also do not work.
  Workaround: use a context menu (right click) in the field being edited.

* If you select an image that has a location and them pan the map to some
  other locations, changing the map style causes the map to re-center around
  the pin if the pin is off screen. If the pin is on screen the map viewport
  doesnâ€™t change.

Misc:
* Clean up lat/lon display, perhaps use NumberFormater?

Feature Requests:
* check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the user
  if necessary.
* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.
