Bug?

* crash in PathView using Xcode 14.3 beta and beta 2.  Crash comes and
  goes even with no code changes.  Seems to be an Xcode thread sanitizer bug.
  Reported to Apple.

* If you select an image that has a location and them pan the map to some
  other locations, changing the map style causes the map to re-center around
  the pin if the pin is off screen. If the pin is on screen the map viewport
  doesnâ€™t change.

* Performance is terrible when loading large number of images.  1200 images
  on my 2019 iMac takes about 20 seconds to load.  Clicking on an image
  takes about 5 seconds before the thumbnail is shown.  Much (most?) of the
  time is in SwiftUI code.

Misc:
* Clean up lat/lon display, perhaps use NumberFormater?

Feature Requests:
* check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the user
  if necessary.
* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.
