Known bugs are now in the README file

Feature Requests:
- check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the
  user if necessary.
- Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

WIP notes

- needs lots of testing
- see bookmarked code
- log exiftool errors? Add method to save and show log on screen? I think that
  can be done.
