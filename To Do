Fixed:
* map search bar alignment (trailing)
* Add command-L as shortcut for locn from track
* do not apply track log points when time +/- 6 hours of image time
* Fixed multiple sheets when loading good and bad track logs
* Fixed crash -- missing environment object when scrolling table
* remove "Publishing changes from within view updates is not allowed" warnings
  due to SwiftUI sometimes having problems binding to Published variables.
* Open With now works
* Depricated code to change map types removed.  Now using map configuaration
* Use custom pin that changes during drag operations. Replaces deprecated code.

Bugs:
* Right pane divider location on start -- partially fixed
* When Metal validation enabled program crashes when divider is moved

Future?
* Create sidecar option???
* add option to hide grayed out images???

Feature Requests:
* Add and option to show the location of all selected images.
* check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the user
  if necessary.
* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.
