Feature Requests:

* Add and option to show the location of all selected images.

* check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the user
  if necessary.

* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

* Would it be worth putting in the preferences or somewhere the ability
  to put in a tag to indicate that the photo has GPS data in it.   On a
  save if GPS data is there it also saves the Tag.  Just an idea.
