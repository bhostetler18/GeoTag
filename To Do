Bug?

* crash in PathView using Xcode 14.3 beta and beta 2.  Crash comes and
  goes even with no code changes.  May be an Xcode bug as the program has
  yet to crash when running standalone.

* filename-1.ext in sandbox not showing location when location in is xmp file
  that should be pointed to by filename-1.xmp in sandbox.  The links in
  the sandbox are correct.
  - created xmp file has quarantine attribute?
  - removing quarantine still sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.'

* If you select an image that has a location and them pan the map to some other locations, changing the map style causes the map to re-center around the pin if the pin is off screen. If the pin is on screen the map viewport doesnâ€™t change.

Misc:
* Clean up lat/lon display, perhaps use NumberFormater?

Feature Requests:
* check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the user
  if necessary.
* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.
