Known bugs are now in the README file

Feature Requests:
- Would be nice to be able to copy the coordinates in the same format as
  selected in the GeoTag settings.
- Access images in the photos library.
- check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the
  user if necessary.
- Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

WIP notes

- undo/redo disabled.  Why?
- Map not positioned when item selected and pin is off screen
- search does not update selected items.  Should it? It did with the old maps
  but I'm now thinking that might not be the right thing to do.
- handle display of other selected pins
