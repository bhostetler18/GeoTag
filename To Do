Known bugs are now in the README file

Feature Requests:
- Would be nice to be able to copy the coordinates in the same format as
  selected in the GeoTag settings.
- Access images in the photos library.
- check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the
  user if necessary.
- Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

WIP notes

- undo/redo disabled.  Why?
- handle display of other selected pins
- Perhaps the map should not be focusable as now moving a pin takes the
  focus from the table.
- however ^^^ when that is done the search field dos not go away if the
  user clicks on the map.   Hmmmm.
- Escape in the search text field does not get rid of SearchView.
