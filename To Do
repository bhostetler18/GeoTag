Feature Requests:

* removed loaded gps tracks

* Paste into Change Image Location Window

* Add and option to show the location of all selected images.

* check for overlap before assigning locations from a track log and warn the user
  if necessary.

* Handle location display of video files.  Exiftool does not allow updates.

* When the Photos app opens up for extensions, I hope GeoTag will be there to
  take advantage of it!  This has become my favorite program in just a few
  hours of use.  [Note: I expect apple to add a map interface to Photos.]
  
* Would it be worth putting in the preferences or somewhere the ability
  to put in a tag to indicate that the photo has GPS data in it.   On a
  save if GPS data is there it also saves the Tag.  Just an idea.

Bugs:

* Copy/Paste doesn't use the current selected location format, but instead
  assumes dd.ddddddd format.
